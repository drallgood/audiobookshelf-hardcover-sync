Many inside the company were eager to prove that Apple could be just as innovative as it had been under Jobs. Others were painfully aware of the immense challenge ahead. As its business has become more complex and global, Apple has come under intense scrutiny, much of it critical. Maintaining market leadership has become crucial as it tries to conquer new frontiers and satisfy the public's insatiable appetite for \"insanely great\" products. </p> <p>Based on over 200 interviews with current and former executives, business partners, Apple watchers, and others, <i>Haunted Empire</i> is an illuminating portrait of Apple today that offers clues to its future. With nuanced insights and colorful details that only a seasoned journalist could glean, Kane goes beyond the myths and headlines. She explores Tim Cook’s leadership and its impact on Jobs’ loyal lieutenants, new product development, and Apple’s relationships with Wall Street, the government, tech rivals, suppliers, the media, and consumers. </p> <p>Hard-hitting yet fair, <i>Haunted Empire</i> reveals the perils and opportunities an iconic company faces when it loses its visionary leader.</p>","isbn":null,"asin":"B00I8OW9R2","language":"English","explicit":false,"abridged":false},"coverPath":"/audiobooks/Yukari Iwatani Kane/Haunted Empire [B00I8OW9R2]/cover.jpg","tags":["Professionals & Academics","Business"],"numTracks":1,"numAudioFiles":1,"numChapters":23,"duration":45239.278322,"size":359640098},"numFiles":7,"size":360246384},{"id":"ec74064f-1b3a-4dbc-ba3b-37d907ff23e9","ino":"4294967463","oldLibraryItemId":null,"libraryId":"5634360d-ad3d-424d-bebb-6439c1d1323e","folderId":"10595e3c-61cb-46c9-80c7-40c9665c4261","path":"/audiobooks/Will Smith/Will [0593146239]","relPath":"Will Smith/Will [0593146239]","isFile":false,"mtimeMs":1748859822141,"ctimeMs":1748859822141,"birthtimeMs":1730584620335,"addedAt":1748781023111,"updatedAt":1748859834671,"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"mediaType":"book","media":{"id":"3f308996-ecae-4885-8eec-c824c61777c0","metadata":{"title":"Will","titleIgnorePrefix":"Will","subtitle":null,"authorName":"Will Smith, Mark Manson","authorNameLF":"Smith, Will, Manson, Mark","narratorName":"Will Smith","seriesName":"","genres":["Biographies & Memoirs"],"publishedYear":"2021","publishedDate":null,"publisher":"Penguin Audio","description":"<p><b>One of the most dynamic and globally recognized entertainment forces of our time opens up fully about his life, in a brave and inspiring book that traces his learning curve to a place where outer success, inner happiness, and human connection are aligned.

In the wake of his close collaborator’s death, the chief designer wrestled with grief and initially threw himself into his work designing the new Apple headquarters and the Watch before losing his motivation in a company increasingly devoted more to margins than to inspiration.</p> <p>In many ways, Cook was Ive’s opposite. The product of a small Alabama town, he had risen through the ranks from the supply side of the company. His gift was not the creation of new products. Instead, he had invented countless ways to maximize a margin, squeezing some suppliers, persuading others to build factories the size of cities to churn out more units. He considered inventory evil. He knew how to make subordinates sweat with withering questions.</p> <p>Jobs selected Cook as his successor, and Cook oversaw a period of tremendous revenue growth that has lifted Apple’s valuation to $2 trillion. He built a commanding business in China and rapidly distinguished himself as a master politician who could forge global alliances and send the world’s stock market into freefall with a single sentence.</p> <p>Author Tripp Mickle spoke with more than 200 current and former Apple executives, as well as figures key to this period of Apple’s history, including Trump administration officials and fashion luminaries such as Anna Wintour while writing <i>After Steve</i>. His research shows the company’s success came at a cost. Apple lost its innovative spirit and has not designed a new category of device in years. Ive’s departure in 2019 marked a culmination in Apple’s shift from a company of innovation to one of operational excellence, and the price is a company that has lost its soul.</p> <p>Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>","isbn":null,"asin":"B09CF3K1XT","language":"English","explicit":false,"abridged":false},"coverPath":"/audiobooks/Tripp Mickle/After Steve [B09CF3K1XT]/cover.jpg","tags":["Entertainment & Celebrities","Professionals & Academics","Business","Science & Technology","Management & Leadership","Management"],"numTracks":1,"numAudioFiles":1,"numChapters":33,"duration":52980.636667,"size":842661853},"numFiles":7,"size":848555252},{"id":"0f123829-2c8b-4d12-8dee-e42f042db953","ino":"19327352969","oldLibraryItemId":null,"libraryId":"5634360d-ad3d-424d-bebb-6439c1d1323e","folderId":"10595e3c-61cb-46c9-80c7-40c9665c4261","path":"/audiobooks/Tony Hsieh/Delivering Happiness [B003O5FNTG]","relPath":"Tony Hsieh/Delivering Happiness [B003O5FNTG]","isFile":false,"mtimeMs":1748859826776,"ctimeMs":1748859826776,"birthtimeMs":1730584620332,"addedAt":1748781025408,"updatedAt":1748859871694,"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"mediaType":"book","media":{"id":"8820cb58-20f9-48dc-9ddb-494bde30b664","metadata":{"title":"Delivering Happiness","titleIgnorePrefix":"Delivering Happiness","subtitle":"A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose","authorName":"Tony Hsieh","authorNameLF":"Hsieh, Tony","narratorName":"Tony Hsieh","seriesName":"","genres":["Business & Careers"],"publishedYear":"2010","publishedDate":null,"publisher":"Hachette Audio","description":"<p>In this, his first audiobook, Tony Hsieh - the widely admired CEO of Zappos, the online shoe retailer - explains how he created a unique culture and commitment to service that aims to improve the lives of employees, customers, vendors, and backers.

What if you could change it back? </p> <p>In this brilliantly conceived tour de force, Stephen King - who has absorbed the social, political, and popular culture of his generation more imaginatively and thoroughly than any other writer - takes listeners on an incredible journey into the past and the possibility of altering it. </p> <p>It begins with Jake Epping, a 35-year-old English teacher in Lisbon Falls, Maine, who makes extra money teaching GED classes. He asks his students to write about an event that changed their lives, and one essay blows him away: a gruesome, harrowing story about the night more than 50 years ago when Harry Dunning’s father came home and killed his mother, his sister, and his brother with a sledgehammer. Reading the essay is a watershed moment for Jake, his life - like Harry’s, like America’s in 1963 - turning on a dime. </p> <p>Not much later his friend Al, who owns the local diner, divulges a secret: his storeroom is a portal to the past, a particular day in 1958. And Al enlists Jake to take over the mission that has become his obsession - to prevent the Kennedy assassination. </p> <p>So begins Jake’s new life as George Amberson, in a different world - of Ike and JFK and Elvis, of big American cars and sock hops and cigarette smoke everywhere. From the dank little city of Derry, Maine (where there’s Dunning business to conduct), to the warmhearted small town of Jodie, Texas, where Jake falls dangerously in love, every turn is leading, eventually of course, to a troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald and to Dallas, where the past becomes heart-stoppingly suspenseful - and where history might not be history anymore.

And it all starts with <i>why</i>. </p> <p>Any organization can explain what it does; some can explain how they do it; but very few can clearly articulate why. Why is not money or profit - those are always results. Why does your organization exist? Why does it do the things it does? Why do customers really buy from one company or another? Why are people loyal to some leaders but not others? Starting with <i>why</i> works in big business and small business, in the nonprofit world and in politics. Those who start with <i>why</i> never manipulate, they inspire. And people follow them not because they have to; they follow because they want to.

[a] blockbuster memoir.”—</b><b><i>The New Yorker </i></b><b>(Best Books of the Year)</b></p> <p>It was one of the most searing images of the twentieth century: two young boys, two princes, walking behind their mother’s coffin as the world watched in sorrow—and horror. As Princess Diana was laid to rest, billions wondered what Prince William and Prince Harry must be thinking and feeling—and how their lives would play out from that point on.</p> <p>For Harry, this is that story at last.</p> <p>Before losing his mother, twelve-year-old Prince Harry was known as the carefree one, the happy-go-lucky Spare to the more serious Heir. Grief changed everything. He struggled at school, struggled with anger, with loneliness—and, because he blamed the press for his mother’s death, he struggled to accept life in the spotlight.</p> <p>At twenty-one, he joined the British Army. The discipline gave him structure, and two combat tours made him a hero at home. But he soon felt more lost than ever, suffering from post-traumatic stress and prone to crippling panic attacks. Above all, he couldn’t find true love.</p> <p>Then he met Meghan. The world was swept away by the couple’s cinematic romance and rejoiced in their fairy-tale wedding. But from the beginning, Harry and Meghan were preyed upon by the press, subjected to waves of abuse, racism, and lies. Watching his wife suffer, their safety and mental health at risk, Harry saw no other way to prevent the tragedy of history repeating itself but to flee his mother country. Over the centuries, leaving the Royal Family was an act few had dared. The last to try, in fact, had been his mother. . . .</p> <p>For the first time, Prince Harry tells his own story, chronicling his journey with raw, unflinching honesty. A landmark publication, <i>Spare</i> is full of insight, revelation, self-examination, and hard-won wisdom about the eternal power of love over grief.</p>","isbn":null,"asin":"B0BJ4X9D2F","language":"English","explicit":false,"abridged":false},"coverPath":"/audiobooks/Prince Harry, The Duke of Sussex/Spare/cover.jpg","tags":["Politics & Activism","Royalty","Europe","Great Britain"],"numTracks":1,"numAudioFiles":1,"numChapters":238,"duration":56361.594036,"size":456054284},"numFiles":3,"size":456668035},{"id":"53d78e3c-a310-44fb-a214-051776e73497","ino":"6442451094","oldLibraryItemId":null,"libraryId":"5634360d-ad3d-424d-bebb-6439c1d1323e","folderId":"10595e3c-61cb-46c9-80c7-40c9665c4261","path":"/audiobooks/Patrick Stewart/Making It So [B0BW253L7G]","relPath":"Patrick Stewart/Making It So [B0BW253L7G]","isFile":false,"mtimeMs":1748859829719,"ctimeMs":1748859829719,"birthtimeMs":1730584620333,"addedAt":1748781029803,"updatedAt":1748859872749,"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"mediaType":"book","media":{"id":"7f9c9a44-eb5c-4221-ad92-0613055ac938","metadata":{"title":"Making It So","titleIgnorePrefix":"Making It So","subtitle":"A Memoir","authorName":"Patrick Stewart","authorNameLF":"Stewart, Patrick","narratorName":"Patrick Stewart","seriesName":"","genres":["Biographies & Memoirs"],"publishedYear":"2023","publishedDate":null,"publisher":"Simon & Schuster Audio","description":"<p><b>Winner of the 2024 Audie Award for Autobiography/Memoir</b><br /> <br /> <b>THE </b><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES</i></b><b> AND </b><b><i>USA TODAY </i></b><b>BESTSELLER</b><br /> <br /> <b>The renowned and bestselling memoir—written with “insight, truth, and passion” (Sir Ian McKellen)—from iconic, beloved actor and living legend Sir Patrick Stewart.</b><br /> <br /> From his acclaimed stage triumphs to his legendary onscreen work, Sir Patrick Stewart has captivated audiences around the world and across multiple generations in a career spanning six decades with his indelible command of stage and screen.

Aboard it, they will find both death and wonders—the life support that is failing on their own ship, room to grow, and labs in which to explore their own genetic anomaly and the mysterious disease that killed the ship's colony.<br /> <br /> <i>Shadows in Flight</i> is the fifth novel in Orson Scott Card's Shadow Series.</p>","isbn":null,"asin":"B006L7BE8S","language":"English","explicit":false,"abridged":false},"coverPath":"/audiobooks/Orson Scott Card/Shadows in Flight [B006L7BE8S]/cover.jpg","tags":["Science Fiction","Adventure","Military","Space Opera"],"numTracks":1,"numAudioFiles":1,"numChapters":12,"duration":23010.870023,"size":183388839},"numFiles":6,"size":184121168},{"id":"4ecb88a5-6426-4968-9a2e-4db2da7782bf","ino":"159","oldLibraryItemId":null,"libraryId":"5634360d-ad3d-424d-bebb-6439c1d1323e","folderId":"10595e3c-61cb-46c9-80c7-40c9665c4261","path":"/audiobooks/Orson Scott Card/Shadow of the Hegemon [B002V0TMT2]","relPath":"Orson Scott Card/Shadow of the Hegemon [B002V0TMT2]","isFile":false,"mtimeMs":1748859830893,"ctimeMs":1748859830893,"birthtimeMs":1730584620334,"addedAt":1748781031408,"updatedAt":1748859873254,"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"mediaType":"book","media":{"id":"c1669ac3-a78f-4d8b-a07f-87cab19cb029","metadata":{"title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","titleIgnorePrefix":"Shadow of the Hegemon","subtitle":null,"authorName":"Orson Scott Card","authorNameLF":"Card, Orson Scott","narratorName":"David Birney, Scott Brick, Gabrielle de Cuir","seriesName":"The Enderverse #8, Ender's Shadow #2","genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy"],"publishedYear":"2002","publishedDate":null,"publisher":"Macmillan Audio","description":"<p><i>Ender's Game</i> told the story of the boy \"Ender\" Wiggin and his hard-won victory over an alien race that would have destroyed the Earth and all of humanity.

A thin web of ships in both asteroid belts; a few stations; a corporate settlement on Luna. No one had seen any sign of other space-faring races; everyone expected that First Contact, if it came, would happen in the future, in the empty reaches between the stars. Then a young navigator on a distant mining ship saw something moving too fast, heading directly for our sun.<br /> <br /> When the alien ship screamed through the solar system, it disrupted communications between the far-flung human mining ships and supply stations, and between them and Earth. So Earth and Luna were unaware that they had been invaded until the ship pulled into Earth orbit, and began landing terra-forming crews in China. Politics and pride slowed the response on Earth, and on Luna, corporate power struggles seemed more urgent than distant deaths.

That would certainly let me sail straight out of here. The course of wisdom, surely. </p> <p>But I’m not giving in—not to the mals, not to fate, and especially not to the Scholomance. I’m going to get myself and my friends out of this hideous place for good—even if it’s the last thing I do. </p> <p><b>With keen insight and mordant humor, Novik reminds us that sometimes it is not enough to rewrite the rules—sometimes, you need to toss out the entire rulebook.</b> </p> <p><b>The magic of the Scholomance trilogy will continue in </b><b><i>The Golden Enclaves</i></b><b>.</b></p>","isbn":null,"asin":"0593287436","language":"English","explicit":false,"abridged":false},"coverPath":"/audiobooks/Naomi Novik/The Last Graduate [0593287436]/cover.jpg","tags":["Genre Fiction","Coming of Age","Fantasy","Epic","Paranormal & Urban","Contemporary"],"numTracks":1,"numAudioFiles":1,"numChapters":16,"duration":48435.488345,"size":769442318},"numFiles":6,"size":770157545},{"id":"36296a55-fda5-4a4e-b5c1-c5e45f288206","ino":"6442451096","oldLibraryItemId":null,"libraryId":"5634360d-ad3d-424d-bebb-6439c1d1323e","folderId":"10595e3c-61cb-46c9-80c7-40c9665c4261","path":"/audiobooks/Naomi Novik/The Golden Enclaves [B09NQKQRWL]","relPath":"Naomi Novik/The Golden Enclaves [B09NQKQRWL]","isFile":false,"mtimeMs":1748859834184,"ctimeMs":1748859834184,"birthtimeMs":1730584620333,"addedAt":1748781036064,"updatedAt":1748859874673,"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"mediaType":"book","media":{"id":"c5057bbd-35ef-4d4b-ae7d-5ca36a45d99a","metadata":{"title":"The Golden Enclaves","titleIgnorePrefix":"Golden Enclaves, The","subtitle":"The Scholomance, Book 3","authorName":"Naomi Novik","authorNameLF":"Novik, Naomi","narratorName":"Anisha Dadia","seriesName":"Scholomance #3","genres":["Literature & Fiction","Science Fiction & Fantasy"],"publishedYear":"2022","publishedDate":null,"publisher":"Random House Audio","description":"<p><b>#1 NATIONAL BESTSELLER • Saving the world is a test no school of magic can prepare you for in the triumphant conclusion to the </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling trilogy that began with </b><b><i>A Deadly Education</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>The Last Graduate.</i></b></p> <p><b>FINALIST FOR THE HUGO AWARD • ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: </b><b><i>Paste, Publishers Weekly</i></b></p> <p>The one thing you never talk about while you’re in the Scholomance is what you’ll do when you get out.

In<i> The Light We Carry,</i> she opens a frank and honest dialogue with listeners, considering the questions many of us wrestle with: How do we build enduring and honest relationships? How can we discover strength and community inside our differences? What tools do we use to address feelings of self-doubt or helplessness?

Drawing from her experiences as a mother, daughter, spouse, friend, and First Lady, she shares the habits and principles she has developed to successfully adapt to change and overcome various obstacles—the earned wisdom that helps her continue to “become.” She details her most valuable practices, like “starting kind,” “going high,” and assembling a “kitchen table” of trusted friends and mentors. With trademark humor, candor, and compassion, she also explores issues connected to race, gender, and visibility, encouraging listeners to work through fear, find strength in community, and live with boldness.<br /> <br /> “When we are able to recognize our own light, we become empowered to use it,” writes Michelle Obama.

He tells it like it is - a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. <i>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck</i> is his antidote to the coddling, let's-all-feel-good mind-set that has infected modern society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up. </p> <p>Manson makes the argument, backed by both academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited - \"not everybody can be extraordinary; there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault\". Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek. </p> <p>There are only so many things we can give a f*ck about, so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience.

Materially, everything is the best it’s ever been - we are freer, healthier, and wealthier than any people in human history. Yet, somehow everything seems to be irreparably and horribly f*cked - the planet is warming, governments are failing, economies are collapsing, and everyone is perpetually offended on Twitter. At this moment in history, when we have access to technology, education, and communication our ancestors couldn’t even dream of, so many of us come back to an overriding feeling of hopelessness. </p> <p>What’s going on? If anyone can put a name to our current malaise and help fix it, it’s Mark Manson. In 2016, Manson published <i>The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck</i>, a book that brilliantly gave shape to the ever-present, low-level hum of anxiety that permeates modern living. He showed us that technology had made it too easy to care about the wrong things, that our culture had convinced us that the world owed us something when it didn’t - and worst of all, that our modern and maddening urge to always find happiness only served to make us unhappier. Instead, the “subtle art” of that title turned out to be a bold challenge: to choose your struggle; to narrow and focus and find the pain you want to sustain. The result was a book that became an international phenomenon, selling millions of copies worldwide while becoming the number-one best seller in 13 different countries. </p> <p>Now, in <i>Everthing Is F*cked</i>, Manson turns his gaze from the inevitable flaws within each individual self to the endless calamities taking place in the world around us. Drawing from the pool of psychological research on these topics, as well as the timeless wisdom of philosophers such as Plato, Nietzsche, and Tom Waits, he dissects religion and politics and the uncomfortable ways they have come to resemble one another. He looks at our relationships with money, entertainment, and the internet, and how too much of a good thing can psychologically eat us alive. He openly defies our definitions of faith, happiness, freedom - and even of hope itself.</p> <p>With his usual mix of erudition and where-the-f*ck-did-that-come-from humor, Manson takes us by the collar and challenges us to be more honest with ourselves and connected with the world in ways we probably haven’t considered before. It’s another counterintuitive romp through the pain in our hearts and the stress of our soul. One of the great modern writers has produced another book that will set the agenda for years to come. </p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b> </p>","isbn":null,"asin":"0062888447","language":"English","explicit":false,"abridged":false},"coverPath":"/audiobooks/Mark Manson/Everything Is F*cked [0062888447]/cover.jpg","tags":["Personal Development","Personal Success","Comedy & Humor","Literature & Fiction","Satire"],"numTracks":1,"numAudioFiles":1,"numChapters":13,"duration":25343.688345,"size":402587520},"numFiles":7,"size":403578626},{"id":"a1da7e6a-44cc-48ae-8e5e-1c2e4af0b72d","ino":"19327352984","oldLibraryItemId":null,"libraryId":"5634360d-ad3d-424d-bebb-6439c1d1323e","folderId":"10595e3c-61cb-46c9-80c7-40c9665c4261","path":"/audiobooks/Marcus Buckingham/Nine Lies About Work [1469074087]","relPath":"Marcus Buckingham/Nine Lies About Work [1469074087]","isFile":false,"mtimeMs":1748859837214,"ctimeMs":1748859837214,"birthtimeMs":1730584620334,"addedAt":1748781039956,"updatedAt":1748859875901,"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"mediaType":"book","media":{"id":"ebcc655f-4c30-43c5-9139-1d88efcefd5c","metadata":{"title":"Nine Lies About Work","titleIgnorePrefix":"Nine Lies About Work","subtitle":"A Freethinking Leader's Guide to the Real World","authorName":"Marcus Buckingham, Ashley Goodall","authorNameLF":"Buckingham, Marcus, Goodall, Ashley","narratorName":"Marcus Buckingham, Ashley Goodall","seriesName":"","genres":["Business & Careers","Relationships, Parenting & Personal Development"],"publishedYear":"2019","publishedDate":null,"publisher":"Gildan Media","description":"<p>Your organization's culture is the key to its success.

Once, a long time ago, I walked down a night-darkened road called Firefly Lane, all alone, on the worst night of my life, and I found a kindred spirit. That was our beginning. More than 30 years ago. TullyandKate. You and me against the world. Best friends forever. </p> <p>But stories end, don't they? You lose the people you love and you have to find a way to go on...Tully Hart has always been larger than life, a woman fueled by big dreams and driven by memories of a painful past. She thinks she can overcome anything until her best friend, Kate Ryan, dies. Tully tries to fulfill her deathbed promise to Kate - to be there for Kate's children - but Tully knows nothing about family or motherhood or taking care of people. Sixteen-year-old Marah Ryan is devastated by her mother's death. Her father, Johnny, strives to hold the family together, but even with his best efforts, Marah becomes unreachable in her grief. Nothing and no one seems to matter to her...until she falls in love with a young man who makes her smile again and leads her into his dangerous, shadowy world. </p> <p>Dorothy Hart - the woman who once called herself Cloud - is at the center of Tully's tragic past. She repeatedly abandoned her daughter, Tully, as a child, but now she comes back, drawn to her daughter's side at a time when Tully is most alone.

Then, to her amazement, the \"coolest girl in the world\" moves in across the street and wants to be her friend. Tully Hart seems to have it all - beauty, brains, ambition. On the surface they are as opposite as two people can be: Kate, doomed to be forever uncool, with a loving family who mortifies her at every turn. Tully, steeped in glamour and mystery, but with a secret that is destroying her. They make a pact to be best friends forever; by summer's end they've become <i>TullyandKate.</i> Inseparable.</p> <p>So begins Kristin Hannah's magnificent new novel. Spanning more than three decades and playing out across the ever-changing face of the Pacific Northwest, <i>Firefly Lane</i> is the poignant, powerful story of two women and the friendship that becomes the bulkhead of their lives. </p> <p>From the beginning, Tully is desperate to prove her worth to the world. Abandoned by her mother at an early age, she longs to be loved unconditionally. In the glittering, big-hair era of the eighties, she looks to men to fill the void in her soul. But in the buttoned-down nineties, it is television news that captivates her. She will follow her own blind ambition to New York and around the globe, finding fame and success...and loneliness. </p> <p>Kate knows early on that her life will be nothing special. Throughout college, she pretends to be driven by a need for success, but all she really wants is to fall in love and have children and live an ordinary life. In her own quiet way, Kate is as driven as Tully. What she doesn't know is how being a wife and mother will change her...how she'll lose sight of who she once was, and what she once wanted. And how much she'll envy her famous best friend....</p> <p>For thirty years, Tully and Kate buoy each other through life, weathering the storms of friendship - jealousy, anger, hurt, resentment. They think they've survived it all until a single act of betrayal tears them apart...and puts their courage and friendship to the ultimate test.</p> <p><i>Firefly Lane</i> is for anyone who ever drank Boone's Farm apple wine while listening to Abba or Fleetwood Mac. More than a coming-of-age novel, it's the story of a generation of women who were both blessed and cursed by choices. It's about promises and secrets and betrayals. And ultimately, about the one person who really, truly knows you - and knows what has the power to hurt you...and heal you. <i>Firefly Lane </i>is a story you'll never forget...one you'll want to pass on to your best friend.</p>","isbn":null,"asin":"B002UZLH4Q","language":"English","explicit":false,"abridged":false},"coverPath":"/audiobooks/Kristin Hannah/Firefly Lane [B002UZLH4Q]/cover.jpg","tags":["Classics","Genre Fiction","Family Life","Friendship","Sagas","Women's Fiction"],"numTracks":1,"numAudioFiles":1,"numChapters":41,"duration":64501.933333,"size":513079767},"numFiles":6,"size":514545750},{"id":"670d2d50-dbfe-44e8-add9-fc5ed71a14bb","ino":"6442451097","oldLibraryItemId":null,"libraryId":"5634360d-ad3d-424d-bebb-6439c1d1323e","folderId":"10595e3c-61cb-46c9-80c7-40c9665c4261","path":"/audiobooks/Kristie Macrakis/Nothing Is Beyond Our Reach [B0C2W2M2CC]","relPath":"Kristie Macrakis/Nothing Is Beyond Our Reach [B0C2W2M2CC]","isFile":false,"mtimeMs":1748859838670,"ctimeMs":1748859838670,"birthtimeMs":1730584620334,"addedAt":1748781042157,"updatedAt":1748859876424,"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"mediaType":"book","media":{"id":"da708ac9-c6e8-4ff0-bdca-4185c4bf98c7","metadata":{"title":"Nothing Is Beyond Our Reach","titleIgnorePrefix":"Nothing Is Beyond Our Reach","subtitle":"America's Techno-Spy Empire","authorName":"Kristie Macrakis","authorNameLF":"Macrakis, Kristie","narratorName":"Wendy Tremont King","seriesName":"","genres":["Computers & Technology","History","Politics & Social Sciences"],"publishedYear":"2023","publishedDate":null,"publisher":"Tantor Audio","description":"<p>Ever since the earliest days of the Cold War, American intelligence agencies have launched spies in the sky, implanted spies in the ether, burrowed spies underground, sunk spies in the ocean, and even tried to control spies' minds by chemical means.

If they failed to address the regulators' concerns within the year, the company could go up in smoke. </p> <p>She didn't understand. How had her team let this happen? How had she let this happen? </p> <p>Over the past several years, IUI had executed a digital transformation strategy following the business accelerating principles of Agile and DevOps.

But along the way IUIs manual governance process had become inundated with friction, frustration, and failure for the teams attempting to deliver value for their organizations. </p> <p>Now, it's all hands on deck for a cross-functional team of executives and engineers to develop a modern automated governance process that satisfies regulators without slowing the company's ability to meet customer demands and compete in the market.</p> <p>In the vein of bestselling titles <i>The Phoenix Project</i> and <i>The Unicorn Project</i>, Investments Unlimited helps organizations radically rethink how they handle audit, compliance, and security for their software systems.

The result of thorough research, keen insight, and unassailable common sense, <i>Good Calories, Bad Calories</i> immediately stirred controversy and acclaim among academics, journalists, and writers alike.

He also answers the most persistent questions: Why are some people thin and others fat? What roles do exercise and genetics play in our weight? What foods should we eat, and what foods should we avoid? </p> <p>Packed with essential information and concluding with an easy-to-follow diet, <i>Why We Get Fat</i> is an invaluable key in our understanding of an international epidemic and a guide to what each of us can do about it. </p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b> </p>","isbn":null,"asin":"B004D5K512","language":"English","explicit":false,"abridged":false},"coverPath":"/audiobooks/Gary Taubes/Why We Get Fat [B004D5K512]/cover.jpg","tags":["Aging & Longevity","Fitness","Diet & Nutrition","Diets","Nutrition & Healthy Eating","Weight Loss & Weight Control","Exercise & Fitness","Social Sciences","Personal Development"],"numTracks":1,"numAudioFiles":1,"numChapters":25,"duration":28701.193333,"size":228366854},"numFiles":9,"size":461650425},{"id":"0d1ac79f-0007-4633-b5c3-d9f50bce4082","ino":"19328984624","oldLibraryItemId":null,"libraryId":"5634360d-ad3d-424d-bebb-6439c1d1323e","folderId":"10595e3c-61cb-46c9-80c7-40c9665c4261","path":"/audiobooks/Felicia Day/Third Eye [B0C8VJV8W1]","relPath":"Felicia Day/Third Eye [B0C8VJV8W1]","isFile":false,"mtimeMs":1748859846262,"ctimeMs":1748859846262,"birthtimeMs":1736691276751,"addedAt":1748781054092,"updatedAt":1748859879213,"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"mediaType":"book","media":{"id":"25acd793-b0ed-4b57-9556-fdda16a94d21","metadata":{"title":"Third Eye","titleIgnorePrefix":"Third Eye","subtitle":"The Renowned Story of One Man's Spiritual Journey on the Road to Self-Awareness","authorName":"Felicia Day","authorNameLF":"Day, Felicia","narratorName":"Sean Astin, Felicia Day, Neil Gaiman, LilyPichu, London Hughes, Wil Wheaton, full cast","seriesName":"","genres":["Science Fiction & Fantasy"],"publishedYear":"2023","publishedDate":null,"publisher":"Audible Originals","description":"<p><b>2024 Audie Award winner for Audio Drama</b></p> <p>Get ready for a hilarious fantasy adventure crafted by master storyteller Felicia Day.

She was supposed to be the Chosen One. The plan was simple: She would vanquish the great evil Tybus in an epic battle. But destiny had other ideas, and Laurel's performance in the whole heroics department was a colossal flop.</p> <p>Now, instead of being a legendary hero, Laurel's the resident pariah of the magic realm. And what’s worse, the dark wizard Tybus swooped in, took over the realm, and forced all supernatural creatures to live under his tyrannical rule. He’s even stripped away the magical powers of those who refused to join his wicked cause. Yeah, everyone hates her. Well, everyone except her two roomies—Sybil, the sassiest diva of a fairy, who could throw shade with the flick of a wing. And Frank, the vampire who rocks a bald spot and a serious paunch. They are the real MVPs, the ride-or-die buddies who have her back, no matter how many colossal fails she racks up.</p> <p>And it’s all about to get even weirder. Along comes Kate, a Normie who somehow knows more about Laurel than Laurel knows about herself. Turns out, she's got some secrets up her sleeve that might just give Laurel a shot at redemption and a chance to rewrite her destiny.</p> <p><i>Third Eye</i> is a side-splitting adventure that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Laurel and her ragtag team of misfits must embark on a wild journey to take down Tybus. It's a treacherous path, but they'll have to put their differences aside and work together.

Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman's seminal studies in behavioral psychology, behavioral economics, and happiness studies have influenced numerous other authors, including Steven Pinker and Malcolm Gladwell. In <i>Thinking, Fast and Slow</i>, Kahneman at last offers his own, first book for the general public. It is a lucid and enlightening summary of his life's work. It will change the way you think about thinking. </p> <p>Two systems drive the way we think and make choices, Kahneman explains: System One is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System Two is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Examining how both systems function within the mind, Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities as well as the biases of fast thinking and the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and our choices. Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, he shows where we can trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking, contrasting the two-system view of the mind with the standard model of the rational economic agent. </p> <p>Kahneman's singularly influential work has transformed cognitive psychology and launched the new fields of behavioral economics and happiness studies. In this path-breaking book, Kahneman shows how the mind works, and offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and personal lives - and how we can guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. </p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b> </p>","isbn":null,"asin":"B005TKKCWC","language":"English","explicit":false,"abridged":false},"coverPath":"/audiobooks/Daniel Kahneman/Thinking, Fast and Slow [B005TKKCWC]/cover.jpg","tags":["Career Success","Decision-Making & Problem Solving","Psychology & Mental Health","Psychology"],"numTracks":1,"numAudioFiles":1,"numChapters":46,"duration":72131.451655,"size":573115041},"numFiles":7,"size":575412162},{"id":"f4fdbef9-5e81-4c66-b76f-4ab6e04c8fb9","ino":"17179869350","oldLibraryItemId":null,"libraryId":"5634360d-ad3d-424d-bebb-6439c1d1323e","folderId":"10595e3c-61cb-46c9-80c7-40c9665c4261","path":"/audiobooks/Daniel H.

For years now, leaders in almost every industry have accepted two completely false assumptions: that change is hard and that engagement drives results. Those beliefs have inspired expensive attempts to shield employees from change, involve them in high-level decision-making, and keep them happy with endless satisfaction surveys and workplace perks. But what these engagement programs actually do, Cy Wakeman says, is inflate expectations and sow unhappiness, leaving employees unprepared to adapt to even minor changes necessary to the organization's survival. Rather than driving performance and boosting efficiency, these programs fuel entitlement and drama, costing millions in time and profit. </p> <p><i>No Ego</i> is about increasing awareness of just how often individuals are operating out of ego at work, breeding drama and discord rather than innovation and constructive collaboration. It is high time to reinvent leadership thinking. The current work experience is so full of emotional waste that it's seen as a foregone cost in today's business environments. Cy Wakeman teaches straightforward strategies in which this time and energy can be re-commissioned and put toward the value that hired talent is intended to provide. <i>No Ego</i> disposes with unproven HR maxims, and instead offers a complete plan to turn your office from a den of discontent into a highly productive place where happy employees are accountable employees. </p>","isbn":null,"asin":"B077XS9SFY","language":"English","explicit":false,"abridged":false},"coverPath":"/audiobooks/Cy Wakeman/No Ego [B077XS9SFY]/cover.jpg","tags":["Management & Leadership","Leadership","Management"],"numTracks":1,"numAudioFiles":1,"numChapters":12,"duration":17143.42,"size":136389579},"numFiles":6,"size":136901605},{"id":"f8da9673-65ec-4526-bc24-31c785708204","ino":"12884902024","oldLibraryItemId":null,"libraryId":"5634360d-ad3d-424d-bebb-6439c1d1323e","folderId":"10595e3c-61cb-46c9-80c7-40c9665c4261","path":"/audiobooks/Craig Alanson/Zero Hour [B078RV7BWR]","relPath":"Craig Alanson/Zero Hour [B078RV7BWR]","isFile":false,"mtimeMs":1748859851777,"ctimeMs":1748859851777,"birthtimeMs":1730584620332,"addedAt":1748781061254,"updatedAt":1748859881028,"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"mediaType":"book","media":{"id":"a718e125-5c2a-468d-8317-a0bb2345433a","metadata":{"title":"Zero Hour","titleIgnorePrefix":"Zero Hour","subtitle":"Expeditionary Force, Book 5","authorName":"Craig Alanson","authorNameLF":"Alanson, Craig","narratorName":"R.C.

In <i>Working Backwards</i>, these two long-serving Amazon executives reveal and codify the principles and practices that drive the success of one of the most extraordinary companies the world has ever known. With 27 years of Amazon experience between them, much of it in the early aughts - a period of unmatched innovation that brought products and services including Kindle, Amazon Prime, Amazon Studios, and Amazon Web Services to life - Bryar and Carr offer unprecedented access to the Amazon way as it was refined, articulated, and proven to be repeatable, scalable, and adaptable.</p> <p>With keen analysis and practical steps for applying it at your own company - no matter the size - the authors illuminate how Amazon’s 14 leadership principles inform decision-making at all levels and reveal how the company’s culture has been defined by four characteristics: customer obsession, long-term thinking, eagerness to invent, and operational excellence. Bryar and Carr explain the set of ground-level practices that ensure these are translated into action and flow through all aspects of the business.</p> <p><i>Working Backwards</i> is a practical guidebook and a corporate narrative, filled with the authors’ in-the-room recollections of what “Being Amazonian” is like and how it has affected their personal and professional lives. They demonstrate that success on Amazon’s scale is not achieved by the genius of any single leader, but rather through commitment to and execution of a set of well-defined, rigorously executed principles and practices - shared here for the very first time. </p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Press</b> </p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio. </b></p>","isbn":null,"asin":"1250788048","language":"English","explicit":false,"abridged":false},"coverPath":"/audiobooks/Colin Bryar/Working Backwards [1250788048]/cover.jpg","tags":["Management & Leadership","Leadership","Management","Business Development & Entrepreneurship"],"numTracks":1,"numAudioFiles":1,"numChapters":18,"duration":38477.861678,"size":611359050},"numFiles":7,"size":613687239},{"id":"d52e22d0-452e-4ec8-834f-75479dcf4afe","ino":"2236010085","oldLibraryItemId":null,"libraryId":"5634360d-ad3d-424d-bebb-6439c1d1323e","folderId":"10595e3c-61cb-46c9-80c7-40c9665c4261","path":"/audiobooks/Christopher Golden/Slayers [B0CGJ1DNQ1]","relPath":"Christopher Golden/Slayers [B0CGJ1DNQ1]","isFile":false,"mtimeMs":1748859854848,"ctimeMs":1748859854848,"birthtimeMs":1736691293858,"addedAt":1748781067032,"updatedAt":1748859882659,"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"mediaType":"book","media":{"id":"09f8b22f-d136-40fd-b514-1fc6cefafeba","metadata":{"title":"Slayers: A Buffyverse Story","titleIgnorePrefix":"Slayers: A Buffyverse Story","subtitle":"The Watcher's Guide Authorized","authorName":"Christopher Golden, Amber Benson","authorNameLF":"Golden, Christopher, Benson, Amber","narratorName":"Amber Benson, Charisma Carpenter, James Charles Leary, Emma Caulfield Ford, Juno Dawson, Laya DeLeon Hayes, Anthony Head, Juliet Landau, James Marsters, Danny Strong","seriesName":"","genres":["Literature & Fiction","Science Fiction & Fantasy"],"publishedYear":"2023","publishedDate":null,"publisher":"Audible Originals","description":"<p>Original cast members from the beloved TV series, <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>, reunite for an all-new adventure about connections that never die—even if you bury them.</p> <p>A decade has passed since the epic final battle that concluded <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i> (TV).

Soon Bryan was haunting the local movie theater, memorizing and reenacting favorite scenes with his older brother. Acting was clearly the boy's destiny - until one day his father disappeared. Suddenly destiny took a backseat to survival. </p> <p>Seeking something more stable, perhaps subconsciously trying to distance himself from his absent father, Cranston decided on a career in law enforcement. But then, while a young man on a classic cross-country motorcycle trip, Cranston one day found himself stranded at a rest area in the Blue Ridge Mountains. To pass the time, he read a tattered copy of <i>Hedda Gabler</i>, and in a flash he found himself face-to-face once again with his original calling. Suddenly he thought <i>this</i> was what he wanted to do, what he would do, with the rest of his life. Act. </p> <p>In his riveting memoir, <i>A Life in Parts</i>, Cranston traces his zigzag journey from his chaotic childhood to his dramatic epiphany and beyond, to megastardom and a cultlike following, by vividly revisiting the many parts he's played on camera and off. With great humor and much humility, Cranston chronicles his unlikely rise from a soap opera regular trying to learn the ropes and the politics of show business on the fly to a recurring spot as Tim Whatley on <i>Seinfeld</i>, finding himself an indelible part of popular culture. He recalls his run as the well-meaning goofball, Hal, on <i>Malcolm in the Middle</i>, proving to writers and fans that he was willing to do anything, <i>anything</i>, for a laugh, and he gives a bracing account of his run on Broadway as President Lyndon Johnson, pushing himself to the limit as he prepared, physically and mentally, for a tour de force that would win him a Tony to go along with his four Emmys. </p> <p>Of course Cranston dives deep into the grittiest, most fascinating details of his greatest role, explaining how he searched inward for the personal darkness that would help him create one of the most riveting performances ever captured on-screen: Walter White, chemistry teacher turned drug kingpin. </p> <p>Discussing his failures as few men do, describing his work as few actors can, Cranston has much to say about innate talent and its benefits, challenges, and proper maintenance, but ultimately <i>A Life in Parts</i> is about the necessity and transformative power of hard work. </p>","isbn":null,"asin":"B01F7MG56S","language":"English","explicit":false,"abridged":false},"coverPath":"/audiobooks/Bryan Cranston/A Life in Parts [B01F7MG56S]/cover.jpg","tags":["Entertainment & Performing Arts","Film & TV","Entertainment & Celebrities"],"numTracks":1,"numAudioFiles":1,"numChapters":70,"duration":31993.741678,"size":254777751},"numFiles":6,"size":256079116},{"id":"589c0745-29f6-4461-8c6d-0098d7a89810","ino":"111306906","oldLibraryItemId":null,"libraryId":"5634360d-ad3d-424d-bebb-6439c1d1323e","folderId":"10595e3c-61cb-46c9-80c7-40c9665c4261","path":"/audiobooks/Britney Spears/The Woman in Me","relPath":"Britney Spears/The Woman in Me","isFile":false,"mtimeMs":1748859855505,"ctimeMs":1748859855505,"birthtimeMs":1736697774842,"addedAt":1748781068140,"updatedAt":1748862002397,"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"mediaType":"book","media":{"id":"21d596fe-c41c-4ce0-afd1-9e02a1c34ff4","metadata":{"title":"The Woman in Me","titleIgnorePrefix":"Woman in Me, The","subtitle":null,"authorName":"Britney Spears","authorNameLF":"Spears, Britney","narratorName":"Michelle Williams, Britney Spears - introduction","seriesName":"","genres":["Biographies & Memoirs"],"publishedYear":"2023","publishedDate":null,"publisher":"Simon & Schuster Audio","description":"<p><b>Named a Best Book of the Year by </b><b><i>Elle</i></b><b>,</b><b><i> The Washington Post</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>Rolling Stone</i></b><b>, NPR,</b><b><i> Financial Times</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>Vanity Fair,</i></b><b> and more!</b></p> <p><b>“In Britney Spears’s memoir, she’s stronger than ever.” —</b><b><i>The New York Times</i></b></p> <p><b>Over 2 million copies sold of the “moving” (</b><b><i>Time</i></b><b>), “powerful” (</b><b><i>Los Angeles Times</i></b><b>), “radiant” (</b><b><i>The New York Times</i></b><b>), “poignant” (</b><b><i>Vogue</i></b><b>) #1 </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>bestseller. </b><b><i>The Woman in Me</i></b><b> is a brave and astonishingly moving story about freedom, fame, motherhood, survival, faith, and hope.</b><br /> <br /> In June 2021, the whole world was listening as Britney Spears spoke in open court.

A leader is anyone who takes responsibility for recognizing the potential in people and ideas and has the courage to develop that potential. </p> <p>When we dare to lead, we don’t pretend to have the right answers; we stay curious and ask the right questions. We don’t see power as finite and hoard it; we know that power becomes infinite when we share it with others. We don’t avoid difficult conversations and situations; we lean into vulnerability when it's necessary to do good work. </p> <p>But daring leadership in a culture that’s defined by scarcity, fear, and uncertainty requires skill-building around traits that are deeply and uniquely human. The irony is that we’re choosing not to invest in developing the hearts and minds of leaders at the exact same time as we’re scrambling to figure out what we have to offer that machines and AI can’t do better and faster. What can we do better? Empathy, connection, and courage, to start. </p> <p>Brené Brown has spent the past two decades studying the emotions and experiences that give meaning to our lives, and the past seven years working with transformative leaders and teams spanning the globe. She found that leaders in organizations ranging from small entrepreneurial startups and family-owned businesses to nonprofits, civic organizations, and Fortune 50 companies all ask the same question: </p> <p><i>How do you cultivate braver, more daring leaders, and how do you embed the value of courage in your culture?</i> </p> <p>In this new audiobook, Brown uses research, stories, and examples to answer these questions in the no-BS style that millions have come to expect and love. Brown writes, “One of the most important findings of my career is that daring leadership is a collection of four skill sets that are 100 percent teachable, observable, and measurable. It’s learning and unlearning that requires brave work, tough conversations, and showing up with your whole heart. Easy? No. Because choosing courage over comfort is not always our default. Worth it? Always. We want to be brave with our lives and our work. It’s why we’re here.”</p> <p>Whether you’ve read <i>Daring Greatly</i> and <i>Rising Strong</i> or you’re new to Brené Brown’s work, this audiobook is for anyone who wants to step up and into brave leadership.</p>","isbn":null,"asin":"B07DJYBXNC","language":"English","explicit":false,"abridged":false},"coverPath":"/audiobooks/Brené Brown/Dare to Lead [B07DJYBXNC]/cover.jpg","tags":["Management & Leadership","Leadership","Personal Development","Personal Success"],"numTracks":1,"numAudioFiles":1,"numChapters":13,"duration":29444.468345,"size":234012886},"numFiles":6,"size":234277418},{"id":"b342e5d1-ab5d-4e78-9dba-5c957fb87367","ino":"4294967458","oldLibraryItemId":null,"libraryId":"5634360d-ad3d-424d-bebb-6439c1d1323e","folderId":"10595e3c-61cb-46c9-80c7-40c9665c4261","path":"/audiobooks/Brad Stone/The Everything Store [B00FJJFO1C]","relPath":"Brad Stone/The Everything Store [B00FJJFO1C]","isFile":false,"mtimeMs":1748859855729,"ctimeMs":1748859855729,"birthtimeMs":1730584620334,"addedAt":1748781068459,"updatedAt":1748859883131,"isMissing":false,"isInvalid":false,"mediaType":"book","media":{"id":"dd3eea56-8bcd-43e8-936e-9bb9812a44a4","metadata":{"title":"The Everything Store","titleIgnorePrefix":"Everything Store, The","subtitle":"Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon","authorName":"Brad Stone","authorNameLF":"Stone, Brad","narratorName":"Pete Larkin","seriesName":"","genres":["Biographies & Memoirs","Business & Careers","Money & Finance"],"publishedYear":"2013","publishedDate":null,"publisher":"Hachette Audio ","description":"<p><b>Audie Award Finalist, Business/Educational, 2014</b></p> <p>The definitive story of Amazon.com, one of the most successful companies in the world, and of its driven, brilliant founder, Jeff Bezos. </p> <p>Amazon.com started off delivering books through the mail.

Targeting American utility companies, NATO, and electric grids in Eastern Europe, the strikes grew ever more brazen. They culminated in the summer of 2017, when the malware known as NotPetya was unleashed, penetrating, disrupting, and paralyzing some of the world's largest businesses—from drug manufacturers to software developers to shipping companies. At the attack's epicenter in Ukraine, ATMs froze. The railway and postal systems shut down. Hospitals went dark. NotPetya spread around the world, inflicting an unprecedented ten billion dollars in damage—the largest, most destructive cyberattack the world had ever seen.<br /> <br /> The hackers behind these attacks are quickly gaining a reputation as the most dangerous team of cyberwarriors in history: a group known as Sandworm. Working in the service of Russia's military intelligence agency, they represent a persistent, highly skilled force, one whose talents are matched by their willingness to launch broad, unrestrained attacks on the most critical infrastructure of their adversaries.
