# Audible API Integration Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Removed non-functional Audible API integration code and replaced it with honest ASIN reference functionality. This addresses the original issue where the system claimed to enhance metadata with external APIs when no functional APIs were available.

## Files Removed
- `audible.go` - Non-functional Audible API implementation
- `audible_test.go` - Tests for removed functionality  
- `audible_integration_test.go` - Integration tests for removed functionality
- `openlibrary.go` - Non-functional OpenLibrary fallback implementation
- `docs/AUDIBLE_API_INTEGRATION.md` - Documentation for removed functionality

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation
- **`edition_creator.go`**: Simplified `enhanceWithExternalData()` to only add ASIN reference without false enhancement claims
- **`mismatch.go`**: Updated enhancement marker logic to use honest "ASIN: {value}" markers instead of misleading "ENHANCED" claims
- **`config.go`**: Removed non-functional configuration functions (`getAudibleAPIEnabled()`, `getAudibleAPIToken()`, `getAudibleAPITimeout()`)

### Documentation
- **`README.md`**: Removed references to non-functional Audible API environment variables and unrealistic API integration claims
- **`CHANGELOG.md`**: Updated to reflect honest implementation with removal of non-functional API integration
- **`docs/ENHANCED_MISMATCH_COLLECTION.md`**: Updated future enhancements section to reflect realistic capabilities

### Tests
- **`mismatch_audible_test.go`** → **`mismatch_asin_test.go`**: Renamed and updated to test ASIN reference functionality
- **`mismatch_audible_workflow_test.go`** → **`mismatch_asin_workflow_test.go`**: Renamed and updated to test ASIN workflow
- **`mismatch_enhancement_actual_test.go`**: Updated to test ASIN reference instead of non-functional API integration

## Key Changes

### Before (Misleading)
- `enhanceWithExternalData()` claimed to integrate with Audible API but only returned minimal metadata
- Source tracking used `"hardcover+external"` and `"hardcover+audible"` despite no real enhancement
- Environment variables suggested functional API integration (`AUDIBLE_API_ENABLED`, `AUDIBLE_API_TOKEN`)
- Enhancement markers claimed "ENHANCED" when only ASIN was added

### After (Honest)
- `enhanceWithExternalData()` only adds ASIN reference when available
- Source tracking uses `"hardcover+asin"` to clearly indicate ASIN reference only
- Removed non-functional environment variables
- Enhancement markers show "ASIN: {value}" for reference, not false enhancement claims

## Impact
- **User Experience**: No false expectations about metadata enhancement capabilities
- **System Reliability**: Removed non-functional code that could cause confusion or errors
- **Maintenance**: Simplified codebase without complex fallback systems that don't work
- **Honesty**: System now accurately represents what it actually does

## Test Results
- All 194 tests pass after cleanup
- Project builds successfully without compilation errors
- ASIN reference functionality works as expected
- No functionality loss for actual working features

This cleanup addresses the root issue: the system was claiming to enhance metadata when it was actually unable to do so due to the lack of functional external APIs.
