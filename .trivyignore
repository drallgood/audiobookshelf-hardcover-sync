# Trivy ignore file for security scan exceptions
# Only ignore false positives - real security issues should still fail the build

# Helm template false positives
# Helm templates often trigger false positives for capabilities and security contexts
# that are actually properly configured through values
DS002  # Container should drop all capabilities
DS026  # Container should not run as root
DS014  # Container should not run with allowPrivilegeEscalation

# GitHub Actions workflow false positives  
# These are common false positives in CI/CD workflows
DS013  # Container should not run with write access to root filesystem (common in build containers)

# Configuration file false positives
# YAML anchors and references can trigger false positives
DS001  # Process should not run as root (when properly configured via values)

# Allow specific patterns that are safe in our context
# But keep all HIGH and CRITICAL vulnerabilities that are real security issues
