## [Unreleased]

## [v1.5.0] - 2025-06-08

### Added
- **üìö Owned Books Query Functions**: Added proper owned books querying capabilities
  - **`OwnedBook` struct**: Data structure for representing owned books with complete metadata
  - **`getOwnedBooks()` function**: Retrieves all books from user's "Owned" list using correct GraphQL query
  - **`isBookOwnedDirect()` function**: Checks if a specific book is owned by querying the lists table
  - **Key Discovery**: Hardcover stores ownership in the "Owned" list, not the `user_books.owned` field
  - **Correct API Usage**: Uses `lists` table approach instead of faulty `user_books.owned` field
  - **Well-Documented**: Functions include comments explaining the correct ownership model
  - **Future-Ready**: Core functions available for implementing owned books sync features

### Fixed
- **üìö Owned Flag Auto-Fix**: Fixed and enhanced owned flag handling for books that are skipped during sync
  - Modified `checkExistingUserBook()` to return both owned status and edition_id from Hardcover
  - Updated sync logic to automatically mark books as owned using `edition_owned` mutation when needed
  - Added comprehensive owned flag checking even when status/progress are up-to-date
  - Integrated `markBookAsOwned()` function to actually fix missing owned flags (not just detect them)
  - Enhanced logging for all owned flag operations and edge cases
  - Created comprehensive test coverage for owned flag scenarios
  - **Key improvement**: Books that should be owned are now automatically marked as owned during sync

## [v1.4.1] - 2025-06-07

### Fixed
- **üåç Container Timezone Support**: Fixed timezone handling in Docker containers
  - **Issue**: Container logs showed UTC timestamps regardless of `TZ` environment variable
  - **Solution**: Added `tzdata` package to Alpine base image and timezone configuration in Go application
  - **Functionality**: Container now properly respects `TZ` environment variable (e.g., `TZ=Europe/Vienna`)
  - **Compatibility**: Maintains backward compatibility - works with or without `TZ` variable
  - **Logging**: Application now logs timezone confirmation when `TZ` is set
  - **Technical**: Go application sets `time.Local` based on `TZ` environment variable

## [v1.4.0] - 2025-06-07

### Added
- **üè† Owned Books Marking**: New feature to mark synced books as "owned" in Hardcover
  - **Environment Variable**: `SYNC_OWNED=true` (enabled by default)
  - **Functionality**: Automatically marks synced books as "owned" to distinguish from wishlist items
  - **Integration**: Added to `insert_user_book` GraphQL mutation when creating new user books
  - **Configuration**: Can be disabled with `SYNC_OWNED=false` if ownership tracking not desired
- **üß™ Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Added `owned_test.go` with 12 test cases
  - Tests environment variable parsing with various boolean values
  - Validates default behavior (enabled by default)
  - Ensures proper handling of edge cases and invalid values
- **üìñ Documentation**: Updated README.md with owned books sync section
  - Added `SYNC_OWNED` to environment variables table
  - Created dedicated "Owned Books Sync" configuration section
  - Updated features list to highlight ownership tracking capability

### Changed
- **üìö User Book Creation**: Enhanced sync logic to include ownership information
  - Modified `userBookInput` map to include `"owned": true` when `getSyncOwned()` returns true
  - Only affects newly created books; existing books in Hardcover remain unchanged
  - Ownership status is independent of reading status (Want to Read, Currently Reading, Read)

### Technical Details
- **Config Function**: Added `getSyncOwned()` function following same pattern as `getSyncWantToRead()`
- **Default Behavior**: Enabled by default to provide better library organization out of the box
- **API Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing Hardcover GraphQL mutations
- **Testing**: 100% test coverage for the new functionality with comprehensive edge case handling

## [v1.3.2] - 2025-06-05

### Changed
- **üéØ DEFAULT BEHAVIOR**: "Want to Read" sync is now **enabled by default**
  - **Breaking Change**: `SYNC_WANT_TO_READ` now defaults to `true` instead of `false`
  - **User Impact**: Unstarted books (0% progress) will automatically sync to Hardcover as "Want to Read" status
  - **Migration**: Users who prefer the old behavior can set `SYNC_WANT_TO_READ=false` to disable
  - **Logic Update**: Changed from opt-in (`"true"`) to opt-out (`!= "false", "0", "no"`)

### Added
- **üìñ "Want to Read" Feature Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for the "Want to Read" sync feature
  - Added detailed "Want to Read Sync" section to README.md with use cases and examples
  - Updated environment variables table to reflect new default behavior
  - Added configuration examples and migration guidance
- **üß™ Comprehensive Test Suite**: Created `want_to_read_test.go` with 17 tests
  - 12 environment variable tests covering default behavior and edge cases
  - 5 status logic tests validating status determination for different progress levels
  - 100% test coverage for the "Want to Read" feature

### Fixed
- **üìö Book Filtering Logic**: Enhanced book filtering to properly include 0% progress books when "Want to Read" sync is enabled
  - Updated `runSync()` to check both progress threshold and "Want to Read" configuration
  - Added debug logging for books included via "Want to Read" sync
- **üéõÔ∏è Configuration Logic**: Improved `getSyncWantToRead()` function with robust default handling
  - Defaults to `true` for better out-of-the-box experience
  - Handles edge cases like empty values, invalid strings, and case variations
  - Maintains backward compatibility while improving user experience

### Technical Details
- **Status Mapping**: 0% progress ‚Üí "Want to Read" (status_id=1) when enabled, "Currently Reading" (status_id=2) when disabled
- **Environment Variable**: `SYNC_WANT_TO_READ=true` (default), set to `false`/`0`/`no` to disable
- **Performance**: No performance impact as filtering logic is optimized

## [v1.3.1] - 2025-06-05

### Fixed
- **üö® CRITICAL**: Fixed reading history being wiped out when updating existing `user_book_read` entries
  - **Issue**: When updating progress on existing reads, `started_at: null` was being preserved, removing reading history
  - **Root Cause**: `update_user_book_read` mutation was only sending `progress_seconds` without ensuring `started_at` is set
  - **Fix**: Always set `started_at` to current date when updating existing reads to prevent null values
  - **Impact**: Prevents loss of reading start dates and maintains proper reading history
  - Also ensures `finished_at` is properly set when books reach 99%+ completion
  - Added comprehensive test coverage for the reading history fix

## [v1.3.0] - 2025-06-05

### Added
- **üöÄ Incremental/Delta Sync**: Major performance improvement with timestamp-based incremental syncing
  - Added persistent sync state management with `sync_state.json` file
  - Only processes books with changes since last sync using AudiobookShelf listening session timestamps
  - Automatic fallback to full sync when incremental data is unavailable or on first run
  - Configurable sync modes: `enabled` (default), `disabled`, or `auto`
  - Smart full sync scheduling: automatically performs full sync after 7 days or when forced
  - New environment variables:
    - `INCREMENTAL_SYNC_MODE`: Control incremental sync behavior
    - `SYNC_STATE_FILE`: Custom path for sync state storage (default: `sync_state.json`)
    - `FORCE_FULL_SYNC`: Force full sync on next run (automatically resets after use)
  - Comprehensive logging to show sync mode and progress
  - Reduces API calls significantly for large libraries with minimal changes

### Fixed
- **LibraryItemID Field Reference**: Fixed incorrect field access in incremental sync filtering
  - Changed from `book.Metadata.LibraryItemID` to `book.ID` to match actual data structure
  - Ensures proper book filtering in incremental sync mode
- **Duplicate User Book Reads**: Fixed issue where multiple `user_book_reads` entries were created for the same book when reading across different days
  - Modified `checkExistingUserBookRead()` to check for any unfinished reads instead of date-specific reads
  - Changed GraphQL query from `started_at: { _eq: $targetDate }` to `finished_at: { _is_null: true }`
  - Added ordering by `started_at desc` to get the most recent unfinished read
  - Prevents duplicate read tracking entries when continuing books on different days
- **Panic Fix**: Fixed runtime panic when Hardcover returns `user_book_reads` with null `started_at` values
  - Added nil check for `userBookRead.StartedAt` before dereferencing in debug logs
  - Use "null" string when `StartedAt` is nil instead of causing application crash
  - Prevents `invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference` error

### Changed
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduced `getCurrentUser()` API calls from 3 per book to 1 per sync run
  - Added caching mechanism for current user authentication
  - Cache is cleared at start of each sync run to ensure fresh authentication
  - Significantly reduces API load and improves sync performance for large libraries
  - For 100 books: reduces from 300 API calls to 1 per sync session

### Technical Details
- Added `incremental.go` with sync state management functions
- Enhanced `fetchRecentListeningSessions()` to query AudiobookShelf sessions API with timestamp filtering
- Modified `runSync()` to integrate incremental sync logic with existing sync workflow
- Added comprehensive test coverage for incremental sync functionality
- Backward compatible: existing setups continue to work without configuration changes
