### Technical Details
- **Status Mapping**: 0% progress ‚Üí "Want to Read" (status_id=1) when enabled, "Currently Reading" (status_id=2) when disabled
- **Environment Variable**: `SYNC_WANT_TO_READ=true` (default), set to `false`/`0`/`no` to disable
- **Performance**: No performance impact as filtering logic is optimized

## [v1.3.1] - 2025-06-05

### Fixed
- **üö® CRITICAL**: Fixed reading history being wiped out when updating existing `user_book_read` entries
  - **Issue**: When updating progress on existing reads, `started_at: null` was being preserved, removing reading history
  - **Root Cause**: `update_user_book_read` mutation was only sending `progress_seconds` without ensuring `started_at` is set
  - **Fix**: Always set `started_at` to current date when updating existing reads to prevent null values
